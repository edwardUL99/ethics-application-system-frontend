 * This class is used to resolve autofill query strings. Resolves paths as so:
 * key.property.property1... etc.
 * 
 * For example, if you have an object user with a nested object account with sub-properties, username, email,
 * and the template had an autofill string user.account.email. The user object was registered with register('user', user);
 * The query string will be broken up into the separate properties of user -> account -> email. Email is at the end
 * of the query and exists in the account object, so the value of email is returned. For nested objects along the path,
 * they must be objects and not simple values like numbers or strings. I.e., you can't have user.name.property since name
 * is just a string and not a nested object

   * Register a key with the associated object
   * @param key the key to register the object with
   * @param value the value to associate with the key. The value can be an observable. If it is an observable,
   * it will be resolved before proceeding with the property resolution. for example key.item.value and key is an observable.
   * item is not a property of observable, but it is a property of the value that the observable returns. The sub-properties of value, if 
   * observables won't be resolved, however, and will be treated as further nested values. If the observable throws an error, undefined will be returned and the error logged.
   * 
   * The value can be a generator function that will be executed at resolve time to get the value at the point of time resolve was called, e.g.
   * () => someValue is a generator function that will return someValue when resolve is called
   * 
   * @param proxies this map allows you to 'proxy' property names. For example if the query path 
   * was item.id but the item does not have id, but it does have a property called sequence. If you want to map
   * id to sequence, you can pass in a proxy id: sequence. Now, when you pass in item.id, id will be resolved to sequence
   * and the value will be returned to the client.
   * The proxy can be defined anywhere in the query path as each key in the query path is checked and resolved against the proxy
