      <p class="welcome-text">Welcome to the Faculty of Science and Engineering Research Ethics Web Application System.
        The aim of our committee is to ensure that research is conducted according to best practice and in accordance with ethical standards in research. 
        Our first priority is to safeguard the health, welfare, dignity and rights of human participants and the researchers undertaking the work in order 
        to minimise risk to these parties as well as the University of Limerick itself.
        <br>
        It should be noted that <b>our REC facilitates, not hinders, valuable research</b> and to protect you the researcher from unjustified criticism 
        and/or legal action
